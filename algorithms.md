For modeling the intersection in the backend with its traffic lanes and pedestrian crossings
we used a conflict graph. Each node represents a lane on the intersection.
If the cars of two lanes canÂ´t drive at the same time, because their lanes
cross each other, the conflict graph has an edge between this to nodes.

By coloring the graph it is possible to retrieve all nodes which can drive at the same time.
With Basic Greedy and Welsh Powell we selected two algorithms to color the conflict graph.

## Basic Greedy

The Basic Greedy algorithm is a very easy algorithm for coloring a graph.
The solution heavily depends on the order of the vertices.
Furthermore Basic Greedy does not deliver a colored graph with minimum number of colors.

```
1. Color first vertex with first color.
2. Do following for remaining V-1 vertices.
2.1 Consider the currently picked vertex and color it with the
lowest numbered color that has not been used on any previously
colored vertices adjacent to it. If all previously used colors
appear on vertices adjacent to v, assign a new color to it.
```
